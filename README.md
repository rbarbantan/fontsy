# Fontsy

Takes a snapshot from your camera and changes the font of any text in the picture.

Runs in your browser and uses Google's [Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
This is a toy project and doesn't support yet iOS and Safari as it uses the **getUserMedia** web api (see [can I use](https://caniuse.com/#search=getusermedia))
